# algorithms
This program is a virtual-memory page replacement algorithm simulation that runs different page replacement algorithms and outputs the number of page faults that occur in each run. The program is written in C++. It implements the following page replacement algorithms: First-In First-Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU), and Optimal (OPT). I used C++ and ran it through Linux servers.
